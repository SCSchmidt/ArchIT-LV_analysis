beschreibung: |
  The course will focus on the application of microscopy, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, NIR-UV Reflectance Spectroscopy, and NIR Reflectography to archaeological objects. A short introduction to the fundamentals of the  methods will be followed by practical demonstration and exercises with the equipment hosted at the CSMC on mock-ups and original materials. The data will be evaluated, using the appropriate software, mathematical applications and reference database. Additional methods and equipment might be added depending on availability. Dichotomies such as portable vs. bench equipment, destructive vs. non-destructive and invasive vs. non-invasive methods will be discussed, as well as the strategies and methods for ethical sampling and micro-sampling.
  Prior or contemporary attendance of course 56-326 “Archaeometry and archaeological findings” is mandatory.
